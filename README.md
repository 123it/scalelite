## Configuration

### Redis Connection (`config/redis_store.yml`)

The `config/redis_store.yml` allows specifying per-environment configuration for the Redis server.
The file is similar in structure to the `config/database.yml` file used by ActiveRecord.
By default, a minimal configuration is shipped which will connect to a Redis server on localhost in development, and use "fakeredis" (an in-memory Redis emulator) to run tests without requiring a Redis server.
The default production configuration allows specifying the Redis server connection to use via an environment variable, see below.
You may use this configuration file to set any of the options listed in the [Redis initializer](https://rubydoc.info/github/redis/redis-rb/master/Redis#initialize-instance_method).
Additionally, these options can be set:

* `pool`: The number of connections in the pool (should match number of threads). Defaults to `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` environment variable, otherwise 5.
* `pool_timeout`: Amount of time (seconds) to wait if all connections in the pool are in use. Defaults to 5.
* `namespace`: An optional prefix to apply to all keys stored in Redis.

### Environment Variables

#### Required

* `URL_HOST`: The hostname that the application API enpoint is accessible from. Used to protect against DNS rebinding attacks.
* `SECRET_KEY_BASE`: A secret used internally by Rails. Should be unique per deployment. Generate with `rake secret`.
* `LOADBALANCER_SECRET`: The shared secret that applications will use when calling BigBlueButton APIs on the load balancer. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`
* `REDIS_URL`: URL for connecting to the Redis server, see the [Redis gem documentation](https://rubydoc.info/github/redis/redis-rb/master/Redis#initialize-instance_method). Note that instead of using this environment variable, you can configure the redis server in `config/redis_store.yml`.

#### Optional

* `PORT`: Set the TCP port number to listen on. Defaults to 3000.
* `BIND`: Instead of setting a port, you can set a URL to bind to. This allows using a Unix socket. See [The Puma documentation](https://puma.io/puma/Puma/DSL.html#bind-instance_method) for details.
* `INTERVAL`: Adjust the polling interval (in seconds) for updating server statistics and meeting status. Defaults to 60. Only used by the "poll" task.
* `WEB_CONCURRENCY`: The number of processes for the puma webserver to fork. A reasonable value is 2 per CPU thread or 1 per 256MB ram, whichever is lower.
* `RAILS_MAX_THREADS`: The number of threads to run in the Rails process. The number of Redis connections in the pool defaults to match this value. The default is 5, a reasonable value for production.
* `RAILS_ENV`: Either `development`, `test`, or `production`. The Docker image defaults to `production`. Rails defaults to `development`.
* `BUILD_NUMBER`: An additional build version to report in the BigBlueButton top-level API endpoint. The Docker image has this preset to a value determined at image build time.
* `RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT`: Log to STDOUT instead of a file. Recommended for deployments with a service manager (e.g. systemd) or in Docker. The Docker image sets this by default.
* `REDIS_POOL`: Configure the Redis connection pool size. Defaults to `RAILS_MAX_THREADS`.
